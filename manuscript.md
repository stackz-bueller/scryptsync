Cold Open

*Knock Knock Knock*

“Kassie! Kassie; please come out!”

“I know it tough; I know, but…sweetie you will meet a new friend at this school. I promise! Just please get ready for your first day.”

“Kassie!” 

*Sighing*

“Breakfast is on the table; just please get ready for school. I have a patient coming in and I need to get to my office right after I drop you off”

“Ok.” Kassie replies softly. 

“Thank you sweetie”, her mother replies back; relieved she is putting up less of a fight. Having to meet new people was something Kassie never grasped. 

She mostly tended to herself. But the last time she was thrusted into a new situation, new setting, new people; was when she first got to middle school. 

It took her mother a week just to get her to finally attend school.

Kassie made one friend; unfortunately that friend lived in a different district, so they ended up going to a rival high school. 

Kassie finally crawls out of bed. She steps lightly into her bathroom, always walking on her toes; something she learned in karate, aikido to be exact. 

It was a perfect martial art for her. She learned how to defend herself while also making sure she didn't hurt her opponent. 

Don't misunderstand her tendency to be anti-social, she did not fear confrontation. Her mother had her take classes after she noticed some kids picking on Kassie, she is now a brown belt and will soon be a black belt. Her sensei, aside from her mother, was the only person that she confided in. 

“Kassie! Your food is getting cold!” Her mom yells nicely. 

“Okay mom, I'm almost done getting dressed.”

Kassie finishes with a perfume her mother likes. It was something her grandmother had. It was passed down to her, from her mother. 

It is in a beautiful bottle with a special inscription on the bottom; “she who bares this scent, can bare the weight of the world”. 

Her mother gave it to Kassie as inspiration for going to high school. 

Kassie trots down the steps to the kitchen. On the table is her favorite, cinnamon eggos with turkey sage sausage. 

“Hurry baby, we don't want to be late!”

That's was her mother's way of saying “we don't have time for your syrup ritual.” 

- Syrup Ritual - 

Cut down eggos to little toast, stack vertically, like a loaf. Pour syrup around the perimeter of the loaf. Dip each slice as pull from loaf. 

“Forget it… I don't have much of an appetite.” Kassie exclaimed, followed by shrugging her shoulders. 

“Come here sweetie” [MAIN Parent 1] says caringly, noticing the mood change in her voice. 

Kassie stands abruptly from the table, and trots over toward her mother. They meet for a hug; “sweetie, it will be okay. This first day will be a breeze, and so will the rest!” 

Kassie, holding back tears, replies, “lets just get it over with!”

“I'm with you, let's go.” 

Leaving each other's embrace, her mother grabs the keys and they both walk toward the garage door; leaving the plate of food on the table for their housekeeper. A rarity, leaving dishes out, since [MAIN Parent 1] is a neat freak. 

Nothing wrong with a neat freak. Having a clean house is inviting; but due time constraints, she simply forgot.

# Document 4

The school is magnificent, in size that is. Over 2000 students makes this school one of the largest in the city. Kassie and her mother pull behind the long chain of cars dropping off other students. 

Some in Ubers and Lyfts, others with there actual parents, like Kassie; the rest either walked or caught the city bus. Kassie’s mother Claire, wouldn't dare let Kassie ride the bus. 

In some cases Claire was overprotective. But, what could one expect from a single mother raising her only child. 

“I guess it's about that time”, Claire says as she pulls the car to the drop off point. 

“How is this the drop off point…the school still like a block away?!?” Kassie says, noticing where the front door of the school is.

“Don't try to make small talk” Claire says. 

“You know me too well” Kassie replies. 

“Alright!” Kassie says as she opens the door somewhat aggressively, picks her bag up and begins getting out of the car.

“Sweetie” Claire says as she reaches out to touch Kassie’s shoulder, “have a great day!”

“I’ll try to” Kassie says apprehensively.

“I love you mom”

“I love you too sweetie”

Claire gave a look; the type of look a parent gives when their child is leaving for the Peace Corp or college, or even the Army. The look where they are ready to let go, but don't exactly know how to. 

The how-to for Claire, is her not stopping Kassie from growing as a person.

As Kassie walked toward the school. 

Claire followed right behind her, but not to close to look noticeable; she didn't want to look creepy. 

She followed as far as she could before the street curved toward the main road. And even there, she held up traffic just to make sure Kassie made it to the front door.

*Honk*

*Honk Honk*

“C’mon, move it lady, I got to get to work” someone shouts from one of the cars behind Claire.

Kassie reaches the door.

Since the sky didn't fall in the walk between the car and the school, Claire makes a right and turns onto the main road. 

Everyone held up by her could finally be on there way to work. Most of them were rushing toward jobs they hated, but held anyway, just to maintain their households; a humbling part of adulthood. 

Claire was the opposite, she enjoyed her job. Claire did struggle to become a doctor; every doctor does. The  bright moments of her life because Kassie's father was still alive. 

She help people when they were in need. And that's how she met Kassie's father Benjamin. Being a Doctor is a hard job; seeing someone in sheer pain is hard for someone as empathetic as Claire. 

During her residency in the E.R., a few years before Kassie was born, she saw some horrific things. One of those things was Benjamin shot just below his bulletproof vest. 

He survived; they married a year later. That was why Claire chose to concentrate in Internal Medicine. She wanted to stop problems before they happened. 

If one of Claire’s patients had an above normal blood pressure, she called for diet changes. If a patient’s BMI was above normal standards, she would order a gym membership. As already stated, overprotective. 

That overprotectiveness is also why she has one of the most successful clinics in the state. Most of her patients are have been with her for years, including the one she was rushing to see this morning. 

Kassie walks through 2 sets of doors, one set solid metal with rectangular windows; the other set is glass with the school name arched across them, Settler Prep. 

Founded by Walter Seto in the 1800’s, Settler Prep is one of the most prestigious schools in city. People here make friends fast, since most of them come from the same economical background; wealthy. Kassie’s mother would be considered on the low end even though she was a successful doctor. 

All of the outcasts were financial aid students that weren't playing in any sports or apart of any clubs. Kassie was destined to be one of them as well. 

The hallway just after the entrance was overwhelming; students peppering every inch of the hallway. 

*Hundreds of conversations at once*

*Lockers slamming*

*Stop running through the halls young man!*

*A few students laugh loudly while walking to class*

“Hey; you are clearly new here!” A student says to Kassie. 

“Um!” Kassie says, flabbergasted that someone actually spoke to here. 

For a while there, with all of the students bustling through the hall, she thought she already blended into the crowd. 

“You'll probably want to to visit the main office for your roster.” The random student says to Kassie.

“How did you…” Kassie says, questioning this student’s observation skills. 

“Like I said, you're new here. The office is that way”, the student says, pointing down the hall toward a sign that read “Main Office”.

“My name is Thomas, by the way” as Thomas walks away from Kassie toward his classes. “Enjoy your first day!” He says while his back was turned to Kassie, throwing the peace sign over his shoulder. 

“Bye!” Kassie says under her breath. Maybe it was the anti social thing, or maybe it was just her being smitten by Thomas; but she had the words to speak, she just couldn't. 

She shrugs her interaction with Thomas off and makes her way to the main office.

She opens the door to the office and walks up toward the front desk. A woman, on the phone with someone, raises her index finger to Kassie to tell her “one second please” without breaking her conversation to actually say it.

Kassie waits patiently as the woman talks to the person on the phone about something personal, but clearly not important. Kassie, looking around the office, she notices a window viewing the hallway she came from. 

Two girls were talking to another girl. Their conversation with the one girl was rather passionate. What caught Kassie’s eye was the fact that one of the girls was pointing toward Kassie, without trying to look over at her. 

The girl being talked to nodded to the other two girls and then turned toward the window. Noticing Kassie saw their interaction, she waves away the other girls, then came into the office. 

“Hey Ms. Jones!” the girl says instantly as she walked through the door. 

“Hey Drew!” Ms. Jones replies; putting whoever she was on the phone with on hold. 

“Who are you?” Ms. Jones asked Kassie

“My name is Kassie…Um, I just started today.”

“Ok”; next Ms. Jones started tapping a pen on the desk as she searched for Kassie's roster. “Found it” Ms. Jones exclaims.

“You look kinda busy Ms. Jones; I can show Kassie…Kassie right?” Drew says looking for confirmation from Kassie.

“I'll show Kassie around the school and make sure she gets to her class” Drew says with a cheering smile on her face. 

“You are in safe hands Kassie” Ms. Jones says as she passes Kassie’s roster to Drew. 

Ms. Jones picks up the phone and says “Hey…you still there? Hello? Oh, okay well…” as she waves her hand toward the the girls to leave, then swiveled her chair around. 

“Come on; you class is this way” Drew says while holding open the office door for Kassie

“My name is Drew, by the way”



# Document 5

“Yeah, so Ms. Jones is like the coolest. She's always on the phone so you have to kinda announce yourself when you walk in to get a response from her. She's like 26 too; she's always wearing the dopest clothes too. Straight from the magazine type…why are you so quiet?” Drew say, following it with a giggle. 

“So are you going to say something, or is this a one way street?” Drew followed with. 

“No, I mean yes, I mean” 

*Sighing*

“It's okay, talking is something we can work on” Drew says just to lighten the mood. “Your first class is this way…Pre Calculus. Aye! We have gym together!”

Kassie continues to go along with it, mostly since Drew had her roster.

“Here's your class, room 1023”

*Drew looks through the window to see who was also in her class. She gives a shocked look that then turns to a smile *

“Why don't I attend this class with you, since you aren't really a talker” Drew proposes.

“Come on” Drew says to Kassie as she opens the door to the class. 

“Hello Mr. Brubaker, you have a new student here”

“Hello new student” Mr. Brubaker says to Kassie. “What's your name?”

“Kassie” she says.

“Alright class, we have a new student name Kassie that will be joining us.”

“Okay, find a seat” Mr. Brubaker says to Kassie

Kassie notices that Drew already found a seat. She waves Kassie over to sit with her. As she walks over, she notices Thomas siting next to Drew. 

“Hey newbie… I mean Kassie” Thomas says

“Hey Thomas” Kassie replies

“You already know each other?” Drew asks to both of them

“Yeah, and…”. Thomas says to Drew

Kassie sits down in between Drew and Thomas 

“Wow, you smell amazing” Thomas says rather loudly. 

“Thank you” Kassie replies with a slight blush on her face. She pushed some of her hair behind her ear and turns slightly to hide the blushing. Unfortunately she was turning toward Drew, who notices.

“No reason” Drew says

“Why are you here, you aren't in pre calc yet” Thomas asks Drew

“I'm here to help Kassie” Drew says to Thomas, just to give an answer.

“You know you will be marked absent in your actual class, right” Thomas says

“Yeah, and…” Drew says while folding her arms. 

“Um, Ms. Davenport, you aren't in my class…please go to the class you are supposed to be in before you are late” Mr. Brubaker says sternly

“Fine” Drew says

“Told you” Thomas follows up with

“Whatever; see both of you at gym” Drew says while walking out the class.

“You have gym with us” Thomas asks Kassie

“Yeah, I think so”

“Shoot” 

“What?” Thomas asks

“Drew still has my roster” Kassie says

“It's okay, they’ll give you a pass since it's you first day. Just shadow me until gym class” Thomas proposed to Kassie.

Kassie realized that this may actually benefit her. She doesn't know the school all that well; so, why not she thinks.

“Sure” Kassie says, saying it loud enough this time; she found her speech.

“Since you are chatty back there Thomas, I'm sure you could tell me the derivative of e to the x power.”

“Uhhhh” is all Thomas is able to utter. 

“The answer is e to the x power” Kassie says to save Thomas from embarrassment.

“Correct Kassie; looks like you've found a study partner Thomas”

“Thanks. Lunch is next, we can talk there” Thomas quietly says to Kassie.

After realizing Kassie was up to speed, in terms of Calculus, Mr. Brubaker began to “pop quiz” all of the other students in an arrogant matter. 

*Ding Ding*

“Alright class, remember to do chapters 4 and 5 for homework this weekend.” Mr. Brubaker yells over the ruckus of the students fleeing his class.

“No excuses Josiah, I'm done hearing the ‘dog ate my homework’ clichés”

“Since when was this english class Mr. Brubaker” Josiah says, sarcastically, as he ran out of class. 

“Follow me, the cafeteria is this way”

“Do you think Drew is gonna be there?”

“Probably…and if she is, you'll meet her ‘friends’ too” Thomas says while using air quotes over the word friends. 

“Okay”

They pass through a set of glass doors just down the hall from Mr. Brubaker’s room. Through there, they go to the end of that hall, and go into a stairwell, walking downward toward the cafeteria. 

As Kassie and Thomas made their way down the stairwell, other students gossiped about them. Kassie noticed, but Thomas paid no mind. 

“Did you see those people chatting about us; why would they do that?” Kassie said to Thomas.

“To be honest, I'm pretty popular here. I don't know why though” Thomas replies. 

They both reach the doors to the cafeteria. When they entered, the noise of people chatting went down. 

“That's weird” Kassie says under her breath. 

“There's Drew” Thomas exclaims while pointing to the back corner of the cafeteria. “That's where all of the popular people sit…come on”

As they walk towards Drew, someone next to Drew, tapped her on the shoulder and pointed toward Thomas.

“Hey guys!” Drew yells. “You two look like quite a couple!” She says condescending toward Kassie.

“Do you still have my roster?” Kassie quickly asks Drew

“I gave it back to you in Brubaker’s class” Drew replies

“Um, no you…” Kassie says before being cut off by one of Drew’s friends

“Are you calling her a liar” an unknown friend says

“Chill ladies” Thomas says to the group. “We can grab another one from the office; we already know we have gym together” he continues. 

Thomas asks Kassie, “You hungry?”, just to change up the mood; to which she answers “Not anymore, I'll see you at gym” as she power walked away from the “popular corner”. Thomas yelled “But you don’t know…where it is”, lowering his voice by each word as Kassie walked further away.

Right through the doors of which she came, she asked the first student she saw, “which way is the gym?”

“Yeah, um…go down that hall, make a left into the stairwell, and go up to the third floor. It's on the right, you can't miss it!”

“Thanks uh; what's was your name? I'm Kassie”

“I know, my name is Josiah, we have pre calc together; well see ya, I have to get some food“

“Thanks again Josiah”

“No problem”






# Document 6

Kassie arrived at the gymnasium. She was thrilled Josiah actually gave her the proper directions; some people get a kick out of sending others in wrong direction.

She walks up to the four wooden doors to the gym. She pulled at one of them. “Shoot, it's locked” she says under her breath. 

She turns her back to the wall next to the door, leaned back toward it and slid down it until her bottom touched the floor. She closed her eyes, and in that moment, felt free. In a field with grass up to her ankles. “Turn around” her sensei says. 

“Welcome to your zen place. We come here to clear our minds. We are protected here; however our bodies aren't. So be weary where you meditate!”

“Now, WAKE UP!”, her sensei yells; just then a locker slammed really loud. Kassie's eyes opened to a hallway full of people. The door to the gym, wide open. 

“Hey Kassie…you missed lasagna at lunch” Thomas says to Kassie, always popping up at opportunistic moments.

“I'm not a fan of tomato sauce” she says. Kassie is starting to open up more, all because someone spoke to her. She was started to get more witty with her replies when most other time, she'd be deafeningly quiet. 

Thomas put his hand out for Kassie to help her back to her feet. “They're having burgers tomorrow” he says.

“I don't eat red meat; will they have turkey?” Kassie asks

“We can ask the lunch staff to make us certain foods all the time” Thomas says

“Yeah, for the ‘special’ ones” Drew says as her “entourage” giggled 

“I must have missed the joke” Kassie whispered to Thomas as they both giggle amongst themselves to which Drew stopped to watch over before entering the gym. 

“You like dodgeball?” Thomas asks

“Yeah, actually” Kassie answers

“Well, come on then” Thomas says guides her into the gym; ands still held. When they enter, someone yells “Owhhhh”. 

Everyone looked toward Kassie and Thomas and joined in, much to Drew’s chagrin. 

Kassie and Thomas unlocked hands rather quick, and look toward each other and smirked. “Team Captain!” Thomas yells. “Team Captain” Drew yells. 

“That's a first; team captains picked before anyone got  changed” Mr. Gable yells to the class. “Well, get changed so we can start!”

The class went to their respective locker rooms. “Thomas, I didn't bring gym clothes” Kassie says. 

“No one does, the school have them for the students. Just find your size and put your stuff in a locker. You can put your own number as a code to lock it.” Thomas replies. 

“See you when you get back” He says, followed by him turn away and trotting to the guys locker room. 

Everything was just as Thomas said. It was immaculate; showers with fresh wash clothes and towels ready. Clothes for all sizes and all shapes. The changing area had the lockers around the perimeter, a little too open for Kassie; but her day wasn't going to get bogged down by having to change in front of her classmates. 

When she was done, she put her clothes and book bag in an empty locker; she put in the code 1023, Brubaker’s classroom. 

Kassie closed the door and when she turned to leave, she noticed one of Drew’s friends, one of her many, many friends, looking over her shoulder before faking as if she was stretching the whole time.

“Hey! Just stretching a bit before class!” The random student says.

Kassie, sensing something, begins acting normal but becomes more observant. When she arrives back to gym, she notices that all of the teams were picked and ready to play. 

“Just in time, I picked you for my team” Thomas says. “Cool” Kassie replies, now doubting Thomas’ demeanor. 

“Alright! Get on your lines! 3…2…1”

*Whistle screams*

While everyone else ran for the balls in the middle of the court, Kassie stood, standing on the line; rather unengaged. 

“Here Kassie” Thomas says, tossing a ball to her. 

“Thanks”

Right then two balls wizzed by, one hitting Thomas in the arm. 

The other wizzed to the right of her head; the wind whipping a few of her dreads.

“You're out Thomas” Mr. Gable yelled, with a grin on his face. 

Kassie looked over to seeing the two girls Cassie saw talking to Drew outside the main office, high five Drew. 

Then two more, only aimed at Kassie; how could ten people only want to hit one person? Kassie dips the first one and dove to a roll on the second. On one knee, looking at Drew, she realized that Drew was far from her friend, but why?

“Yeah, Kassie! You can do it! Take em all on!” Thomas yells in encouragement.

“Thomas!” Kassie mind deduces. 

She stands from her knee; a tad bit infuriated, on her first day, someone was proving her right to be anti social. 

Another ball is thrown, aimed at Kassie’s face. Without even looking at it, she raised the ball with both her hands and parries it away. Another one comes again, she parries. 

Kassie crow hops and launches her ball towards Drew; one of her teammates steps in front of it. 

“You're Out Susan!” Mr. Gable yelled

Another ball comes here way. Kassie catches it in mid air. All of Kassie's teammates stop running around after noticing the opposing team only aiming for Kassie. 

“Aim for her teammates” Drew instructs her team. 

*Pat*

“You’re out Abby” Mr. Gable yells

*Slap*

“You too Mary” Mr. Gable yells

The numbers, four to one. 

Kassie launches her ball toward Drew again, but this time Drew dips it and it struck Josiah in the gut, sending him into matted wall.

Kassie picks up a ball next to her; the second she rose up, she had to thrust her hips forward, curving her body just to dodge another one. 

Kassie smirks and runs towards Drew. A ball is hurled at her. Kassie jumped into the air and performing a backflip while twisting in the air; she launches a ball before landing back on the ground. 

The ball hit a student standing next to Drew in the side of the head, then struck the other girl Drew spoke to by the office, square in the face. 

*Whistle Screams*

“Out, Team Drew wins!” Mr. Gables yells

Kassie looked down to see that her front foot was on the midline. 

Drew had a look of someone spared from defeat. 

Thomas came over and high five’d Kassie along with a few of her teammates. Thomas eagerly says, “That was awesome; where did you learn those moves from?” Almost stumbling over his words from excitement 

“I don't know…it…it just came to me” Kassie says, exhausted and dazed. 

“Everyone! Get changed so you can make it to your next class on time!” Mr. Gable orders the class. 

“What was with Drew’s team?!?” Thomas asks Kassie.

“Maybe you should ask her” Kassie replies snappingly.

“I have to go get my roster” Kassie tells Thomas before walk away from Thomas toward the girls locker room. 

Thomas started jogging to catch up with Kassie, asking her “Do you want me to join you?” 

“No, I know my way. Don't be late to class”

“But do you want me to join you?”

“No; I've already made an enemy from hanging with”

“Who, Drew?”

Kassie reaches the door to the locker room, turned to Thomas and said “Look, I'm too tired to talk about it; I'll see you later.”

Kassie turned away from Thomas and walked through the door. “Ok” was all that Thomas was able to say; he had his speech, he just didn't have the words to say.





# Document 7

Kassie enters the locker room, which is nearly empty. She walks toward the locker she used.

As Kassie turned the corner, she noticed the door to her locker open. She runs over to the empty locker to find her book bag and clothes missing.

“Where's my stuff? Where is my stuff?!?!”

“Where!”

*Long sigh*

“Can you feel it? Can you sense where your clothes are, where your book bag is?” Sensei Lee says to Kassie

“Yes Sensei, it's rather faint” Kassie says

“Hold on to that. Ok, you know the drill. Eyes open”

“Hey Drew!” Kassie says, feeling Drew’s presence, though no one was immediately around Kassie. 

“Hey!” Drew says as she creeps from around the corner. “How come you haven't changed yet?”

“Because my clothes are missing; along with my book bag” Kassie says, semi-angrily.

“Where do you think it is?”

“I know exactly where it is”

“Then it's technically not missing, right?”

“It was”

“What changed?”

“You did. Now, my my stuff is innnnnnnnnnnn” Kassie says as she puts her curled index finger to her chin and started pacing away from the empty locker, towards where Drew was standing. 

“This locker” Kassie says

Drew, giving a shocked face but not to over zealous, as to try and still bluff, replies “what's the combination?” Drew says nervously. 

“ABC, easy 1-2-3” Kassie says while punching in the 3 digits, 1,2,3. 

“These are 4 digit lockers sweetheart” Drew says with a smirk which is cut short, as Kassie opens the locker. 

“Oh really!?!?” Kassie replies sarcastically to Drew; her book bag, a good start. But no clothes.

“Found all of your stuff?” Drew asks 

“Partly” Kassie responds

“Hey Drew, you have to see this” Someone out of Kassie's view says

“Good luck finding your stuff, that's not ‘technically’ missing” Drew says while walking away. 

“Shoot; what did I ever do to her? I just want this day to be over!” Kassie says to herself. 

“Your clothes are right here” A voice softly says, similar to the voice that just spoke to Drew. 

Kassie paced to the other side of the lockers to see yet again, one of the girls that spoke to Drew outside of the main office. 

“Are you okay?” Kassie asked, noticing something off. 

“Other than the dodgeball you threw really hard at me, I'm okay. Can't say the same about the others. My name is Beth” 

“Nice to meet you Beth; hate to say it, but you are the fourth person to be nice to me today; why should I believe you are telling the truth?”

“About what?”

“About anything; I saw you talking to Drew back at the office”

“Look, I don't know what it is…maybe you knocked some sense in to me or something; but Drew is planing something against you and I can't be apart of it anymore. And after sees what's upstairs, she will definitely move forward”

“What's upstairs?”

“I told you…you hit me the softest and a patch of my hair is missing.”

“So where are my clothes?”

“Right here” Beth punches in the code 0000, and opened the locker. “Here!” Beth says as she tosses Kassie her clothes. 

“Thanks”

“I am going back upstairs, don't talk to me ever again!” Beth says as she stormed off.

Kassie quickly changes then returns upstairs.

There, she sees Josiah, still pressed up against the matted wall. Kassie jogs over to see what was wrong. “You okay Josiah?” Kassie sincerely asks.  

“Little help” Josiah whispers to Kassie

As Kassie helped get him off the wall, it produced a sound similar to Velcro. As Kassie looked around, each of the students were still down. Drew, tending to one of her friends, slowly looked up at Kassie then rolled her eyes away. 

“You good to walk Josiah” Kassie asks

“Yeah, I'm fine!” Josiah said as he tried to walk toward the bleachers. He took one step then collapsed. 

“I'm fine! I'm fine” Josiah says as if he were in a About to pass out. 

“Walk it off Josiah!” Mr. Gable yelled. “What a fine game Kassie, after a performance like that, I think I can sway the principal to add a new sports to the list” He says with a gleeful smile. 

“Not after she sees five of her students laid out after one game” Kassie replies, followed by her walking away from Mr Gable 

“Mr. Gable! What is the meaning of this!” A women yelled, clearly a superior. 

“Uh, uh,… it was just a little game of dodgeball” Mr Gable says scratching his while trying to giggle away Principal McPherson’s demeanor. 

“My office, now!” Principal McPherson yells, silencing everyone else in the gym. 

“Yes, ma’am” Mr Gable replies as he power walked to catch up to Principal McPherson’s quick pace leaving the gym. 

“Drew definitely doesn't like you now” Thomas says to Kassie, walking into her eye range. “Come on Josiah, I'll take you to the nurse”

“Let me join you”

“Nah, I got this; you had to visit the office, didn't you?” Thomas replied as he walked past Kassie, Josiah’s arm slung around the back of his neck, toward the wooden exit doors.





# Document 73

Cold Open

*Knock Knock Knock*

“Kassie! Kassie, please wake up!”

“I know this is tough on you; I know, but sweetie you will meet a new friend at this school. I promise, just please get ready for your first day of school.”

“Kassie!” 

*Sighing*

“Breakfast is on the table; just please get ready for school. I have a patient coming in and I need to get to my office right after I drop you off”

“Ok.” Kassie replies softly. “Thank you sweetie”, her mother replies back; relieved she is putting up less of a fight. Having to meet new people was something Kassie never grasped. She mostly tended to herself. But the last time she was thrusted into a new situation, new setting, new people; was when she first got to middle school. It took her mother a week just to get her to finally attend school.

Kassie was to make one friend; unfortunately that friend lived in a different district, so they ended up going to a rival high school. 

Kassie finally crawls out of bed. She steps lightly into her bathroom, always walking on her toes; something she learned in karate, aikido to be exact. It was a perfect martial art for her. She learned how to defend herself while also making sure she didn't hurt her opponent. 

Don't misunderstand her tendency to be anti-social, she did not fear confrontation. Her mother had her take classes after she noticed some kids picking on Kassie, she is now a brown belt and will soon be a black belt. Her sensei, aside from her mother, was the only person that she confided in. 

“Kassie! Your food is getting cold!” Her mom yells nicely. 

“Okay mom, I'm almost done getting dressed.”

Kassie finishes with a perfume her mother likes. It was something her grandmother had. It was passed down to her, from her mother. It is in a beautiful bottle with a special inscription on the bottom; “she who bares this scent, can bare the weight of the world”. Her mother could never understand it, so she gave it to Kassie as inspiration for going to high school. 

Kassie trots down the steps to the kitchen. On the table is her favorite, cinnamon eggos with turkey sage sausage. 

“Hurry baby, we don't want to be late!”

That's was her mother's way of saying “we don't have time for your syrup ritual.” 

- Syrup Ritual - 

Cut down eggos to little toast, stack vertically, like a loaf. Pour syrup around the perimeter of the loaf. Dip each slice as pull from loaf. 

“Forget it… I don't have much of an appetite.” Kassie exclaimed, followed by shrugging her shoulders. 

“Come here sweetie” [MAIN Parent 1] says caringly, noticing the mood change in her voice. 

Kassie stands abruptly from the table, and trots over toward her mother. They meet for a hug; “sweetie, it will be okay. This first day will be a breeze, and so will the rest!” 

Kassie, holding back tears, replies, “lets just get it over with!”

“I'm with you, let's go.” 

Leaving each other's embrace, her mother grabs the keys and they both walk toward the garage door; leaving the plate of food on the table for their housekeeper. A rarity, leaving dishes out, since [MAIN Parent 1] is a neat freak. 

Nothing wrong with a neat freak. Having a clean house is inviting; but due time constraints, she simply forgot. 



# Document 74

The school is magnificent, in size that is. Over 2000 students makes this school one of the largest in the city. Kasey and her mother pull behind the long chain of cars dropping off other students. 

Some in Ubers and Lyfts, others with there actual parents, like Kasey; the rest either walked or caught the city bus. Kasey’s mother Claire, wouldn't dare let Kasey ride the bus. 

In some cases Claire was overprotective. But, what could one expect from a single mother raising her only child. 

“I guess it's about that time”, Claire says as she pulls the car to the drop off point. 

“How is this the drop off point…the school still like a block away?!?” Kassie says, noticing where the front door of the school is.

“Don't try to make small talk” Claire says. 

“You know me too well” Kassie replies. 

“Alright!” Kassie says as she opens the door somewhat aggressively, picks her bag up and begins getting out of the car.

“Sweetie” Claire says as she reaches out to touch Kassie’s shoulder, “have a great day!”

“I’ll try to” Kassie says apprehensively.

“I love you mom”

“I love you too sweetie”

Claire gave a look; the type of look a parent gives when their child is leaving for the Peace Corp or college, or even the Army. The look where they are ready to let go, but don't exactly know how to. 

The how-to for Claire, is her not stopping Kassie from growing as a person.

As Kassie walked toward the school. 

Claire followed right behind her, but not to close to look noticeable; she didn't want to look creepy. 

She followed as far as she could before the street curved toward the main road. And even there, she held up traffic just to make sure Kassie made it to the front door.

*Honk*

*Honk Honk*

“C’mon, move it lady, I got to get to work” someone shouts from one of the cars behind Claire.

Kassie reaches the door.

Since the sky didn't fall in the walk between the car and the school, Claire makes a right and turns onto the main road. 

Everyone held up by her could finally be on there way to work. Most of them were rushing toward jobs they hated, but held anyway, just to maintain their households; a humbling part of adulthood. 

Claire was the opposite, she enjoyed her job. Claire did struggle to become a doctor; every doctor does. The  bright moments of her life because Kassie's father was still alive. 

She help people when they were in need. And that's how she met Kassie's father Benjamin. Being a Doctor is a hard job; seeing someone in sheer pain is hard for someone as empathetic as Claire. 

During her residency in the E.R., a few years before Kassie was born, she saw some horrific things. One of those things was Benjamin shot just below his bulletproof vest. 

He survived; they married a year later. That was why Claire chose to concentrate in Internal Medicine. She wanted to stop problems before they happened. 

If one of Claire’s patients had an above normal blood pressure, she called for diet changes. If a patient’s BMI was above normal standards, she would order a gym membership. As already stated, overprotective. 

That overprotectiveness is also why she has one of the most successful clinics in the state. Most of her patients are have been with her for years, including the one she was rushing to see this morning. 

Kassie walks through 2 sets of doors, one set solid metal with rectangular windows; the other set is glass with the school name arched across them, Settler Prep. 

Founded by Walter Seto in the 1800’s, Settler Prep is one of the most prestigious schools in city. People here make friends fast, since most of them come from the same economical background; wealthy. Kassie’s mother would be considered on the low end even though she was a successful doctor. 

All of the outcasts were financial aid students that weren't playing in any sports or apart of any clubs. Kassie was destined to be one of them as well. 

The hallway just after the entrance was overwhelming; students peppering every inch of the hallway. 

*Hundreds of conversations at once*

*Lockers slamming*

*Stop running through the halls young man!*

*A few students laugh loudly while walking to class*

“Hey; you are clearly new here!” A student says to Kassie. 

“Um!” Kassie says, flabbergasted that someone actually spoke to here. 

For a while there, with all of the students bustling through the hall, she thought she already blended into the crowd. 

“You'll probably want to to visit the main office for your roster.” The random student says to Kassie.

“How did you…” Kassie says, questioning this student’s observation skills. 

“Like I said, you're new here. The office is that way”, the student says, pointing down the hall toward a sign that read “Main Office”.

“My name is Thomas, by the way” as Thomas walks away from Kassie toward his classes. “Enjoy your first day!” He says while his back was turned to Kassie, throwing the peace sign over his shoulder. 

“Bye!” Kassie says under her breath. Maybe it was the anti social thing, or maybe it was just her being smitten by Thomas; but she had the words to speak, she just couldn't. 

She shrugs her interaction with Thomas off and makes her way to the main office.

She opens the door to the office and walks up toward the front desk. A woman, on the phone with someone, raises her index finger to Kassie to tell her “one second please” without breaking her conversation to actually say it.

Kassie waits patiently as the woman talks to the person on the phone about something personal, but clearly not important. Kassie, looking around the office, she notices a window viewing the hallway she came from. 

Two girls were talking to another girl. Their conversation with the one girl was rather passionate. What caught Kassie’s eye was the fact that one of the girls was pointing toward Kassie, without trying to look over at her. 

The girl being talked to nodded to the other two girls and then turned toward the window. Noticing Kassie saw their interaction, she waves away the other girls, then came into the office. 

“Hey Ms. Jones!” the girl says instantly as she walked through the door. 

“Hey Drew!” Ms. Jones replies; putting whoever she was on the phone with on hold. 

“Who are you?” Ms. Jones asked Kassie

“My name is Kassie…Um, I just started today.”

“Ok”; next Ms. Jones started tapping a pen on the desk as she searched for Kassie's roster. “Found it” Ms. Jones exclaims.

“You look kinda busy Ms. Jones; I can show Kassie…Kassie right?” Drew says looking for confirmation from Kassie.

“I'll show Kassie around the school and make sure she gets to her class” Drew says with a cheering smile on her face. 

“You are in safe hands Kassie” Ms. Jones says as she passes Kassie’s roster to Drew. 

Ms. Jones picks up the phone and says “Hey…you still there? Hello? Oh, okay well…” as she waves her hand toward the the girls to leave, then swiveled her chair around. 

“Come on; you class is this way” Drew says while holding open the office door for Kassie

“My name is Drew, by the way”

# Document 8

Kassie follows behind Mr Gable and Principal McPherson back toward the main office. Kassie still was new so why not follow someone going in that direction. 

As she tried to keep pace, Principal McPherson notices and stops to confront Kassie; “Are you following us?”

“No, I mean yes; I..” 

“Our with it”

“I don't know my way to the office, and I need a copy of my roster”

“Oh…, well keep up!”

They make it to the office

“Ms Jones can help you Kassie, Kassie right?”

“Yes ma'am”

“In my office Mr Gable!”

“Yes… oh ma'am” Mr Gable says with a smile, walking into the office as if he were a student rather than a teacher. 

“Excuse me, Ms Jones”

*Ms Jones raises her finger*

“Uh huh, and I heard he still live with his momma!”

“Principal McPherson, I think we should get Kassie to tryout for the football team”

“Football season is in the Fall Mr Gable”

“Yeah, but I've never see an arm like that, on a girl at that”

“Mr Gable, stop trying to side track you being here”

“We could win the title with her arm; the boys would be scared to catch passes”

“Mr Gable!”

Kassie begins to grow impatient. There is a vibe in the air, and Ms Jones starts to feel it. “I think it's about to rain, I can feel it in my bones”

*click*

“Hello! Gina, you there?”

Ms Jones hangs the phone up, then picked it up again, but there was no dial tone. “That's weird”

“How can I help you Lassie?”

“Kassie”

“I said that, right?”

“Can I get a copy of my roster?”

Sure, but try not to lose this one. Ms Jones presses a couple of keys on her computer which caused the printer to start making noise. 

The roster is printed and right after Ms Jones hands it to Kassie, the phone rings

“Gina! Girl, what happened, I thought you were playing on the phone!”

“You are here because you decided to have the kids play dodgeball”

“Yeah, dodgeball is fun right?!?”

“Not when it puts student in the infirmary”

“We have an infirmary?”

“The Nurse’s office Mr Gable”

“Oh; so can we ask Kassie about football. It be great for, uh, inclusion and positivity and everything”

“You are still on the hook for today, but you can ask”

“Thanks Boss” Mr Gable says as he opened the office door; “Hey Kassie, you like football?” Mr Gable says with the same childish grin. 

“Um, my Dad used to play, why?”

“Have you ever thought about playing?”

“I'm a girl”

“Yeah, but with your arm we can put you at Quarterback; you know who that is right?”

“Yeah, they throw the ball” 

“Not only that, they control the offense; plus you have other players trying to protect you. We start in the fall, but practice in the spring too. Just come out and see what it's like, what do you think?”

“Sure”

“Outstanding, we have a practice today if you aren't busy after school?” 

“I have to tell my mother, she was going to pick me up after school”

“Please do, and tell her I need a signature too, but I can answer any of her questions” 

Mr Gable turned to Ms Jones and hung the phone up. “Excuse me!” Ms Jones says forcefully. “You're excused” Mr Gable replies. “Here Kassie, call her now”

*Ring Ring*

“Hello”

“Hey mom”

“Kassie, is something wrong?”

“No, um the gym teacher asked me to tryout for the football team and I said yes.”

“You said yes”

“Yes”

“To football?”

“Yes”

“Put the gym teacher on the phone for me”

“Here Mr Gable, my mom wants to speak to you”

“Hello Mrs uh, what's you mom’s name, Kassie?”

“Claire”

“Uh Claire, this is Mr Gable the Physical Education teacher”

*Loud talking start to blare from the phone*

“Yes, ma'am….uh no ma'am”

*Loud talking continues to blare*

So loud Mr Gable moved the phone a few inches from his ear. “Ok ma'am, see you at practice”. Mr Gable hangs up the phone. 

“All your Ms Jones…So your mom is going to attend the practice as well ok” Mr Gable says aloud

“Ok, I have to get to class now”

“Yes, keep your grades up so you can make the team! See you at practice”

“I'm not done with you Mr Gable!”

“Uh…. right, but I have a class now; wouldn't want me late right!?! Bye!”

Mr. Gable says as he scurried out of the office

“Mr. Gable! Get back here!”

“Mr. Gable!”
