---

Kassie follows behind Mr Gable and Principal McPherson back toward the main office. Kassie still was new so why not follow someone going in that direction. 

As she tried to keep pace, Principal McPherson notices and stops to confront Kassie; “Are you following us?”

“No, I mean yes; I..” 

“Our with it”

“I don't know my way to the office, and I need a copy of my roster”

“Oh…, well keep up!”

They make it to the office

“Ms Jones can help you Kassie, Kassie right?”

“Yes ma'am”

“In my office Mr Gable!”

“Yes… oh ma'am” Mr Gable says with a smile, walking into the office as if he were a student rather than a teacher. 

“Excuse me, Ms Jones”

*Ms Jones raises her finger*

“Uh huh, and I heard he still live with his momma!”

“Principal McPherson, I think we should get Kassie to tryout for the football team”

“Football season is in the Fall Mr Gable”

“Yeah, but I've never see an arm like that, on a girl at that”

“Mr Gable, stop trying to side track you being here”

“We could win the title with her arm; the boys would be scared to catch passes”

“Mr Gable!”

Kassie begins to grow impatient. There is a vibe in the air, and Ms Jones starts to feel it. “I think it's about to rain, I can feel it in my bones”

*click*

“Hello! Gina, you there?”

Ms Jones hangs the phone up, then picked it up again, but there was no dial tone. “That's weird”

“How can I help you Lassie?”

“Kassie”

“I said that, right?”

“Can I get a copy of my roster?”

Sure, but try not to lose this one. Ms Jones presses a couple of keys on her computer which caused the printer to start making noise. 

The roster is printed and right after Ms Jones hands it to Kassie, the phone rings

“Gina! Girl, what happened, I thought you were playing on the phone!”

“You are here because you decided to have the kids play dodgeball”

“Yeah, dodgeball is fun right?!?”

“Not when it puts student in the infirmary”

“We have an infirmary?”

“The Nurse’s office Mr Gable”

“Oh; so can we ask Kassie about football. It be great for, uh, inclusion and positivity and everything”

“You are still on the hook for today, but you can ask”

“Thanks Boss” Mr Gable says as he opened the office door; “Hey Kassie, you like football?” Mr Gable says with the same childish grin. 

“Um, my Dad used to play, why?”

“Have you ever thought about playing?”

“I'm a girl”

“Yeah, but with your arm we can put you at Quarterback; you know who that is right?”

“Yeah, they throw the ball” 

“Not only that, they control the offense; plus you have other players trying to protect you. We start in the fall, but practice in the spring too. Just come out and see what it's like, what do you think?”

“Sure”

“Outstanding, we have a practice today if you aren't busy after school?” 

“I have to tell my mother, she was going to pick me up after school”

“Please do, and tell her I need a signature too, but I can answer any of her questions” 

Mr Gable turned to Ms Jones and hung the phone up. “Excuse me!” Ms Jones says forcefully. “You're excused” Mr Gable replies. “Here Kassie, call her now”

*Ring Ring*

“Hello”

“Hey mom”

“Kassie, is something wrong?”

“No, um the gym teacher asked me to tryout for the football team and I said yes.”

“You said yes”

“Yes”

“To football?”

“Yes”

“Put the gym teacher on the phone for me”

“Here Mr Gable, my mom wants to speak to you”

“Hello Mrs uh, what's you mom’s name, Kassie?”

“Claire”

“Uh Claire, this is Mr Gable the Physical Education teacher”

*Loud talking start to blare from the phone*

“Yes, ma'am….uh no ma'am”

*Loud talking continues to blare*

So loud Mr Gable moved the phone a few inches from his ear. “Ok ma'am, see you at practice”. Mr Gable hangs up the phone. 

“All your Ms Jones…So your mom is going to attend the practice as well ok” Mr Gable says aloud

“Ok, I have to get to class now”

“Yes, keep your grades up so you can make the team! See you at practice”

“I'm not done with you Mr Gable!”

“Uh…. right, but I have a class now; wouldn't want me late right!?! Bye!”

Mr. Gable says as he scurried out of the office

“Mr. Gable! Get back here!”

“Mr. Gable!”
